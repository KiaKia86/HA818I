# *H818I*

### A high-performance custom rocket designed entirely from scratch, using a 4-layer avionics PCB, custom airframe, and custom solid motor. The rocket is expected to reach **6,000 ft (≈1,829 m)** at **Mach 0.6**, powered by a **385 N thrust** motor.

### The airframe is constructed with lightweight composite sections reinforced with fiberglass cloth and resin. The rocket includes 2 pyro channels, offering flexibility for multiple deployments and different control configurations.

### The avionics is built on a **4-layer PCB** with one microcontrollers — a **ESP32-S3** — working to process flight data and transmit telemetry via **LoRa** to the ground station. The board includes multiple sensors to track acceleration, rotation, altitude, and GPS position.

### PCB Overview

The **4-layer PCB** serves as the core of the H818I flight computer.  
It uses:
- **ESP32-S3** (Telemetry, communication, logging, and sensor data)  
- **LoRa radio module** for long-range ground communication  
- Multiple onboard sensors: **IMU**, **barometer**, **magnetometer**, **GPS**, and **accelerometer**  
- **Two pyro channels** for deployment   

The avionics system is designed for flexibility, allowing reuse across future rocket designs.

### Why Did I Make This Rocket?

I've wanted to design something that combines all of my passions into one project, and this is it. H818I represents months of hard work, simulation, and testing. Everything I learned about propulsion, control, and flight dynamics has been combined into a single rocket!
